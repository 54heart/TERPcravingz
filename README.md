# TERPcravingz

Business Scenario:

TERPCravingz is a medium sized restaurant review platform that showcases
restaurant information, restaurant review information and UMD Shuttles to the restaurant of
choice.

TerpCravingz has a demand for improvement of customer experience by adding
analytical dashboards on their website as an add-on feature so that the customers can view
these analytical insights and have an overall idea immediately of the best restaurants
around. These dashboards will primarily serve the purpose of immediately letting customers
know which are the three best restaurants, which cuisine is preferred by most people, etc.
Customers can either resort to this dashboard page for insightful information about
restaurants performing best in one or the other category or if the customer already knows
which restaurant they want to visit, they can simply look it up on TERPcravingz website;
information of which TERPcravingz already has on its website. Besides, customers can have
more interaction with others on TERPCravingz by getting the latest recommendations to
restaurants and foods from top 5 active and influential customers. Furthermore,
TERPcravingz offers information about how to reach a particular restaurant using the UMD
shuttle service.

Knowing the background of five database students studying Business Analytics at
University of Maryland, TERPcravingz has decided to hire Team Analytica for developing
this add-on feature for their website.
